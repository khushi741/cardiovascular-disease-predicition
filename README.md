# Myocardial Infarction Complications Analysis and Prediction

## Project Description
This project performs **analysis and prediction of complications after myocardial infarction** using machine learning and visualization techniques. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), neural network modeling, and predictive analytics to understand and predict patient outcomes.

Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and missing value handling
- Visualizing complications, age, and gender-based distributions
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps
- Multi-label prediction of complications using a deep neural network
- Optional logistic regression modeling for classification

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Neural network model for multi-label classification  
- **scikit-learn** – Data preprocessing, logistic regression, and metrics  
- **Google Colab** – Platform for executing the code

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Load dataset and fill missing values.  
   - Separate features and targets.  
   - Standardize feature values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyze frequency of complications overall, by gender, and by age.  
   - Create correlation heatmaps for better understanding of relationships between features and complications.

3. **Neural Network Model:**  
   - Build a multi-layer deep neural network for predicting complications.  
   - Use ReLU activation for hidden layers and Sigmoid for output layer (multi-label classification).  
   - Train and evaluate the model on the dataset.

4. **Logistic Regression Model (Optional):**  
   - Demonstrates binary classification on a synthetic dataset.  
   - Evaluates performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report.

5. **Visualization:**  
   - Bar plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to visualize data insights and model predictions.

## Example Visualizations
- **Frequency of Complications:** Bar plot showing how common each complication is.  
- **Complications by Gender:** Gender-wise distribution of complications.  
- **Complications by Age:** Scatter plots to observe age-related trends.  
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Shows relationships between features and complications.  
- **Predicted Class Distribution:** Pie chart of predicted cardiovascular disease outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning** can help in understanding myocardial infarction complications. The neural network predicts potential complications based on patient features, while EDA helps uncover patterns in the data. These insights can assist in better **risk assessment and decision-making** in healthcare.
